### **Project Outline: AI-Powered Resume Tailoring Website**

---

### **1. Project Overview**
- A web-based tool where users upload their resumes and provide a job posting URL.
- The system scrapes the job post, analyzes it, and suggests improvements to align the resume with the job requirements.
- Users will receive AI-powered recommendations highlighting missing qualifications and keyword mismatches.
- Users can preview suggestions before applying changes.

---

### **2. Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** React (Next.js or standard React)
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (or MongoDB if flexibility is needed)
- **AI/NLP:** OpenAI API, spaCy, BERT, or a fine-tuned transformer model for job matching
- **Scraping:** BeautifulSoup/Scrapy for job post extraction
- **Storage:** AWS S3 (or a local directory for initial development)
- **Authentication:** OAuth (Google Sign-In) or JWT-based authentication

2. **Resume Upload**
   - Accepts PDF, DOCX, or TXT formats.
   - Parses resume content into structured text.

3. **Job Description Scraping**
   - User provides a job posting URL.
   - The backend scrapes the job listing and extracts job title, responsibilities, required skills, and qualifications.

4. **AI-Powered Resume Analysis**
   - **Keyword Matching:** Compare resume keywords with job post requirements.
   - **Missing Qualification Detection:** Identify required skills/experience absent in the resume.
   - **Sentence Optimization:** Suggest improvements for clarity and impact.

5. **Preview & Editing**
   - Display AI-generated suggestions in a Grammarly-style interface.
   - Allow users to accept/reject suggested changes.

6. **Download & Save**
   - Users can download the improved resume.
   - Option to save multiple versions in the database.
