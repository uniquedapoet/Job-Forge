Headquartered out of Denver, CO, we’re a small but mighty team on a mission to be the best and easiest way to learn at work.  

We imagine a world where learning happens in the flow of work. Where employees maximize the minutes of their lives. Where knowledge is contextual, personalized and instantly accessible. Where learning at work is as easy and joyful as it is in our personal lives. This is the future we’re building at Spekit. **Our Product**
Say goodbye to distracted zoom training sessions and lengthy LMS courses your teams will forget. Spekit is the leading just\\-in\\-time enablement platform that meets your reps when and where they need it, in the tools they use every day.  

  

Spekit takes all of your training \\& enablement \\- for applications, processes, sales playbooks, SOPs and more and embeds that training directly in your employees’ tools \\& workflows. Think of Spekit as your employee’s digital sidekick that delivers real\\-time, personalized enablement in their flow of work™. Our unified enablement platform prioritizes three pillars: content, user experience, and flexibility. We focus on delivering the right answer, at the right time – all within a streamlined and intuitive interface. No more information overload, no more hunting for answers. That's Simple, yet Spektacular.  

  

With over $60M in VC funding from Bonfire Ventures, Matchstick Ventures, The Foundry Group, Renegade Partners, The Operator Collective and other top VCs, thousands of employees from scaling startups to Fortune 400 organizations leverage Spekit to onboard new hires, facilitate change management and drive adoption of their tools and applications. **Location:**
Strongly preferred Denver, CO or the surrounding Denver area. Open to remote US locations **ONLY** in the following states: CA, CO, MA, MI, NC, NM, NV, NY, OH, TX, UT, WA, WI. We will not be sponsoring visa applications at this time nor accepting resumes from locations outside of these states or outside of the US.  

  

  

**What Are We Building?**We view the user’s “context” as the app they’re using, the page/URL they’re on, and the task they need to accomplish. Our aim is to harness this context and combine it with the resources our customers upload and input, allowing their teams to be far more effective: from closing sales faster to shortening response times on support tickets. Our unique advantage is how closely we can embed ourselves into each user’s workflow.  

In the coming year, we’ll be: **Recommending Content**: Building intelligence that suggests the most relevant information, resources, or assets at the right time.**Improving Search \\& Retrieval**: Enhancing our AI\\-powered retrieval\\-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline and surfacing answers through a conversational chat interface.**Optimizing User Workflows**: Instrumenting and refining the experience so that content creation, curation, and consumption form a virtuous cycle.**Predicting Needs**: Advancing personalization by predicting what information or resource an individual (or team) will need next, reducing friction and accelerating outcomes. **Why Are We Hiring a Machine Learning Engineer?**
